10.1 tkinter

 

The rest of this course will be taken up with creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for our Python programs. We will be using a library called “tkinter”. tkinter is automatically included in every download of Python 3.x, so you should already have it available for importing.

In order to create a GUI for your Python program using tkinter, you must include

   import tkinter

at the top of any module that uses tkinter.

tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. There are other Python GUI libraries, but tkinter is the standard and most commonly used. tkinter is multiplatform.

Such a strange name requries some explanation: Tcl stands for “Tool Command Language”; it is a scripting language used for rapid prototyping, scripted applications and automated testing. The Tk Toolkit is an extension to Tcl that provides a GUI library for a variety of operating systems. Each GUI consists of one or more frames, and each frame has a layout manager. tkinter is the Tk Toolkit for Python 3.

The previous version of tkinter was called "Tkinter" (note capitalization). The library has changed a bit, but I couldn't find any references to the newer tkinter. I find the following reference to Tkinter the most helpful:

If you find a better reference, please post it to the public Discussion for assignment #10 so that we can all benefit from it!
